        <h4>About me</h4>
        <h1 class="about-h1">Laura Gumienik</h1>
        <p>
          </br>
          Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Laura and I was born in 1986 in Geelong, Australia. 
          </br>
          </br>
          After finishing high school, I studied Civil Engineering at Monash University in Melbourne but was unfulfilled. 
          I took a semester off to think about my future before deciding upon my passion of interior design. 
          I graduated RMIT with a diploma in Interior Decoration and Design and worked in the field for a few years part time.
          Despite enjoying the experience immensely, I couldn't secure full time employment so looked elsewhere and stumbled
          back across to Engineering but this time as a drafsperson.</br>
          </br>
          I currently work as a full time civil and structural draftsperson, however having always been interested in coding, with
          limited experience as part of my high school studies, I decided to try my hand at coding via SheCodes - an intro to
          coding via online classes. I guess the global Covid pandemic made this decision easier, as I finally had time to focus on
          myself throughout the many weeks of lockdowns Victoria imposed on it's citizens.
          </br>
          </br>
          I currently still work as a full time civil and structural draftsperson, however having always been interested in coding, with
          some limited experience as part of my high school studies, I decided to try my hand at coding via SheCodes - an introduction to coding
          via online classes for women. I guess the global Covid pandemic made this decision easier, as I finally had time to focus on myself
          throughout the many weeks of lockdowns Victoria imposed on it's citizens. 
          </br>
          </br>
          Given how much I am loving to learn to code and once again embrace my creative side, I am open to the idea of working as
          a front-end developer, as a pivot in my career.
          I am a logical problem solver, as well as a creative, who is yearning to mesh these two sides together to produce
          efficient and engaging content for a memorable user experience.
          </br>
          </br>
          I hope you like the projects listed on my site - feel free to contact me with any questions.
